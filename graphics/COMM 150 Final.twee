Luckily, Sandra didn't have to learn about the Holocaust through this book, her family is Ashkenazi.

//"Kids’ Right to Read responded to the removal of Laura Esquivel’s Like Water for Chocolate from classrooms in Nampa School District in Idaho. Informal complaints led the school to ban the book, despite the fact alternative assignments were offered and no formal process had been followed. Objections were raised over the sexual content in the book, which is often held as an exemplary text in the genre of magical realism and a foundational work in Mexican feminism."//

Well! That's too bad. That was a good one. Sandra really loves that book. Since you didn't recognize this book, let's have a change of pace. Let's move you to Sandra's Rare Book Collection. But beware! Sandra takes very good care of these books, and doesn't want you messing things up, or worse, TELLING ANYONE about these books. Do you think you can do that?

You've made it to Sandra's rare books. While Sandra holds all of her books near and dear to her heart, these books are particularly important to her, for some reason that no one quite knows. My guess is it's because someone tried to take her books away from her once. These books in particular. For some reason. We've listed the authors here, so go ahead and pick one to read more.

Correct! It is in fact Emma, by the one and only Jane Austen. Sandra likes to come back to this book when she wants to pretend like she understands 19th century feminist literature

...


(she's never read Emma, but frequently watches the movie adaptation starring Anya Taylor Joy)

“And so I try to be kind to everything I see, and in everything I see, I see him.”

"...things get broken, and sometimes they get repaired, and in most cases, you realize that no matter what gets damaged, life rearranges itself to compensate for your loss, sometimes wonderfully.”

"What he knew, he knew from books, and books lied, they made things prettier.”

Notes from Underground, by Fyodor Dostoevsky, is a novella set in 1860s Russia, narrated by an unnamed 'Underground Man'. The story follows the Underground Man and his confused and often contradictory set of memoirs explaining his alienation from modern society.

Sandra often turns to this book when she needs to understand the difference between experience and contemplation, in other words, when she's feeling like a pretentious a**hole.

The Slynx is set two hundred years in the future. The novel follows the lives of those surviving in what was once Moscow after what appears to be nuclear disaster. All of the character have striking physical abnormalities: atavistic tails, scales all over their bodies, claws on their feet instead of toes, and more.

Sandra holds this book near and dear to her heart. For a lot of reasons, but primarly because it was the only female author that she was assigned to read in her 20th Century Russian Literature class, and it was the only book that the entirety of the class chose to sh** on for some reason ... Lol

Wanna see more books in Sandra's library? Go quietly to the [[this section of her library|Rare Books]]

I see you've made it to the library. Now for the fun part - browsing! Sandra keeps her books neat and organized, so you can't just start digging through them willy nilly. And if you start getting things messy, Sandra will probably come for you. So don't!! 

To determine which books would be best for you to dive into, we need to read your vibe. 

For starters, how are you feeling right now?

You've made it to the Titled Library! That is, Sandra's library, but with some titles visible (as opposed to me just guessing a book by your vibe cuz that's a lot of work)

Pick any book you'd like. If you don't know any of the titles that's not my problem just go ahead and pick one that sounds somewhat interesting.

Now that's crazy talk.

This is Sandra's guilty pleasure novel. She reads it to feel something. What exactly? We don't entirely know. But Sandra doesn't want you to just know her by this book, so keep browsing in her library to see more of her collection (please). And just between you and me, I'll let you see the titles of some of the books, but DON'T tell Sandra!!!!

Have you ever heard of Beowulf? It's apparently the greatest poem ever written. Unfortunately, Sandra's library holds the Cotton Vitellius A. XV manuscript (the oldest surviving manuscript of Beowulf), so you actually can't even be in its general vicinity. Sorry!
